It's interesting to see that most developers prefer statically typed language even though dynamic typing provides a higher level of abstraction, allowing even new programmers to write full software. This is even more interesting with JavaScript since there are large number of people in web development and most of them coming from a non-computer science background.

### Additional Comments
This article sheds light on the value of incorporating type annotations into our JavaScript code. By adding type annotations, we can improve the reliability and maintainability of our code. Thus, I am reminded of the importance of being proactive in finding ways to improve the quality of our code. Although type annotations are optional in JavaScript, the benefits they provide make it clear that they are a valuable addition to any project~Lukelo Luoga(ltl2113)
